# SDML Code of Conduct

v0.0.1

## Professional, Not Personal

The SDML project contributors are expected to participate in a manner devoid of interpersonal drama, vendetta, agenda, subterfuge, and the like. At all times, contributors shall conduct themselves in a professional manner, seeking to achieve the goal of the SDML project: improve the SDML software itself.

## Higher Commitments

While the vision for and product of the SDML project is good, contributors are expected to acknowledge higher commitments, such as those pertaining to family, friends, government and so on. At no time shall contributions/work toward the SDML project take precedence over the higher commitments in life.

## Team Fluidity

In keeping with the acknowledgment of higher commitments, it is likely that some contributors may only participate in the SDML project for a brief season, then leave (either for a short time, long time or permanently). Contributions should be well-scoped, and progress should be well-marked, so that other contributors can pick up where a former contributor left off.

## Clarity

Communication and collaboration among contributors to the SDML project are expected to be clear, accurate and precise insofar as is possible.

## Appositeness

Features and improvements should be pertinent and appropriate to the goals of the SDML project. Bringing an agenda to digress, derail or otherwise disrupt the progress of the SDML project is not acceptable.

## Diversity of Thought and Idea

Variation is a crucial aspect for the vitality, nimbleness, agility and adaptability of SDML. Thoughts and ideas which meet the appositeness and goal-orientation check for SDML should be considered, no matter how new or different.

## Crystallization of Fundaments

Locking fundamental features into place is just as crucial as being open to various new ideas. Where features of SDML represent a "core" of functionality, contributors shall be expected to guard and preserve those features, minimizing or eliminating disruption to them. A stable bedrock of features is the best foundation for additional, diverse layers of functionality.

## Adherence to the Correspondence Theory of Reality

Contributors are expected to adhere to the correspondence theory of reality (i.e. use terms that signify/correspond to markers which can be used to identify something in reality). Referring to *something* using a term which does not describe or allow others to readily identify that *something* leads to confusion and disruption in the project.

  - e.g. referring to `[]` as empty square brackets satisfies the correspondence theory of reality
  - e.g. referring to `{}` as an underscore *does not* satisfy the correspondence theory of reality


## Quality Over Speed

Contributions to SDML should be highly relevant, pertinent, easily understood, testable, etc. These goals are not quickly achieved. A measured, steady approach to development is favored over a rushed, sloppy approach.

## Quality over Quantity

Contributions to SDML should be concise and elegant.

  - e.g. use of an abstract class, protocol or other higher-order programming convention is to be desired over repetitive, non-DRY lower-layer object, functional, etc. programming techniques

  - e.g. where one intuitive, simple feature can stand in the place of multiple, fragmented features, the one is to be desired over the others

## Conflict Resolution

Interpersonal conflicts are to be resolved outside of the SDML project. See the **Professional, Not Personal** section of this Code of Conduct.

Professional conflicts may be resolved by orderly, cordial and open discussion with the SDML contributor community (e.g. which feature is the more pertinent, advantageous, etc.?).

Discussions which move into one or more areas of personal conflict do not conform to this Code of Conduct. Contributors to SDML shall make every effort to close, remove, etc. such discussions from SDML contribution discourse.

Any contributor who violates this section of the Code of Conduct is subject losing contributor privileges.

## Accreditation

Recognition, lauds, etc. are reserved for those who have completed work, submitted ideas, etc. regarding a particular feature, bug fix, etc. Contributors are expected to not steal credit from others.
